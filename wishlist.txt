For Christmas all I want is:
  - Rendering to a framebuffer to do a loading screen and post processing
  - Animations imported via assimp
  - fixed VFC?
  - all scene objects included in shadow map render pass
  - multiple butterflies?
  - light spots beneath the particles?
  - some kind of juicy reward when the player collects all colors
  - more cinematic use of the camera/butterfly pathing
  - soften shadows
  - maybe some weird grass or something idk
