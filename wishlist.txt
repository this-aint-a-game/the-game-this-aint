For Christmas all I want is:
  - Rendering to a framebuffer to do a loading screen and post processing
  - TONS of bloom because thats what this game needs                                            - Al
  - Animations imported via assimp                                                              - Derg
  - fixed VFC?
  - all scene objects included in shadow map render pass                                        - Al
  - multiple butterflies?
  - light spots beneath the particles?
  - some kind of juicy reward when the player collects all colors/ every color gets effects    - Crow
  - more cinematic use of the camera/butterfly pathing
  - soften shadows                                                                              - Al
  - maybe some weird grass or something idk
